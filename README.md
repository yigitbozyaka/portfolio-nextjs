This is a Next.js project about my portfolio website.

# Next.js Modern Portfolio

I used Next.js and Framer Motion to build this website.

# Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

After that you can easily start your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Dependencies

I've used [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for the animation some containers and for the Dev Icons I used [devicon-react-svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devicon-react-svg)

# Copyright

Feel free to use this as your portfolio. I would have appreciated it.
